                    I've been looking for problems <br>
                    One look and I'm all in <br>
                    Is it late in the morning? <br>
                    If I fall down then I can keep crawling <br>
                    And it's just like an old friend <br>
                    Coming up, yeah, I know them <br>
                    Drop top in the driveway <br>
                    Locked up 'cause it's slow then <br>

                    I got a couple old friends <br>
                    I swear I'm tryna make amends <br>
                    Forget the years I haven't been <br>
                    And we can ride around again like before <br>
                    Making them fire on lows <br>
                    I got a couple old friends, ya <br>

            <p>In a way it's all a matter of time <br>
                I will not worry for you, you'll be just fine <br>
                Take my thoughts with you, and when you look behind <br>
                You will surely see a face that you recognize <br>
                You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time <br>
                Open your mind, surely it's plain to see <br>
                You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time for you <br>
                Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me <br>
                You're not alone <br>
                Open your mind <br>
                It is the distance that makes life a little hard <br>
                Two minds that once were close, now so many miles apart <br>
                I will not falter though, I'll hold on till you're home <br>
                Safely back where you belong and see how our love has grown <br>
                You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time <br>
                Open your mind, surely it's plain to see <br>
                You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time for you <br>
                Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me <br>
                You're not alone <br>
                Open your mind.
